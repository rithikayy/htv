# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è eyeeyecaptain!

**eyeeyecaptain!** is an assistive technology app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate the world safely.  
At its core, it combines **computer vision** and **voice feedback** to detect nearby objects and estimate their distances ‚Äî empowering users to better understand their surroundings.

---

## üöÄ Overview

For demo purposes, **eyeeyecaptain!** was launched as a **web app** running locally, but it was originally designed as a **mobile application** to provide real-time object and distance detection on the go.

Using **Google‚Äôs Gemini API** for computer vision and **ElevenLabs API** for speech synthesis, the app provides **auditory feedback** in the voice of *Jack the Pirate* ‚Äî bringing accessibility to life in a fun and engaging way.

## üß† Features

- **üîç Object Detection:** Identifies objects in the user‚Äôs environment using Gemini‚Äôs computer vision capabilities.  
- **üìè Distance Detection:** Estimates how far each object is from the user to enhance spatial awareness.  
- **üó£Ô∏è Voice Feedback:** Announces detected objects and distances through Jack the Pirate‚Äôs voice using ElevenLabs API.  
- **üíª Web Demo:** Fully functional prototype running locally for demonstration and testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Camera Feed:** The app accesses the device camera to capture live video input.  
2. **Object Detection:** The Gemini API processes each frame to detect and classify objects.  
3. **Distance Estimation:** The app calculates approximate distances between the user and detected objects.  
4. **Audio Feedback:** Detected objects and their distances are read aloud using ElevenLabs‚Äô Jack the Pirate voice.
